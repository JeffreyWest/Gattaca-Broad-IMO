//SBS2
//Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context
// of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations
// in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5â€™ to the mutated cytosine,
// see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across
// uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.
